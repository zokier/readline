readline
========

This library wraps readline-sys. On Linux and Mac OS X, it allows you to edit
lines reasonably and access your history (with the up arrow and
add\_history()), and on Windows it allows you to edit lines reasonably.

To add to a project

```
[dependencies]
readline = "*"
```

or

```
[dependencies.readline]
git = "https://github.com/zokier/readline.git"
```
